# MINI-MAX-SUM
A list of numbers is fed into the Mini-Max-Sum program, which calculates the smallest and greatest sums from any four of the five elements and shows the results. Sorting the list and adding the lowest four numbers for the least sum and the highest four numbers for the maximum sum is how the miniMaxSum function accomplishes this.
